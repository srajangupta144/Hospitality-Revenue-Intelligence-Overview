## 🔍 Key Insights & Metrics

The dashboard focuses on visualizing and analyzing the following KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):

- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**
- **Occupancy Percentage**
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**
- **Realisation Percentage**
- **City-wise and Property-wise Revenue Trends**
- **Time-based trend analysis for performance forecasting**

These insights help revenue managers and stakeholders to make informed, data-driven strategic decisions for optimizing performance across properties.
